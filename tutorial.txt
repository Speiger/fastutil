How to build source in windows. (Using cygwin)


- Install a linux environment (for example, cygwin or WSL) (google provides help -> "windows install cygwin") (Only a Program not a Operating System)
	- Install with Internet Connection.
	- Install with Use System Settings or Direct Connection. (Default unless you know what you are doing)
	- Use cygwin.mirror.constant.com for plugins.
	- Select the following plugins and its dependencies: automake and dos2unix

- Open the Cygwin terminal and cd to the workspace package.
- Run: "dos2unix gencsource.sh" to ensure the new lines are set correctly.
- Run: "make sources" to generate the sources. This task might need a bit.

- After a while it should be done. First time takes a lot of time because it has to generate "everything" but if you do changes to 1 file afterwards it only will need to compile that.

- Note: Linked & Custom HashMaps might not generate due to symlinks not being supported. Symlinks are basically redirects to another file. 
  Thats why the file only contains a FileName. That is where it should grab the source from.
  If the symlinks do not work just copy the code from the source file and paste it in.
